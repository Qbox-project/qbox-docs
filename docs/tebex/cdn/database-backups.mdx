# Database Backups

Through the CDN dashboard, we also offer database backups at no additional cost.
This means that whatever the size of the database, it will not be counted towards the CDN limits of 20|60|120GB.
The Ducklin tier will get a maximum of 1 backup in total, which will be backed up once every day. Duck and Qboxxer both get 3 max in total, which will be backed up every 3 hours.

To set this up, please first follow [this tutorial](/blog/db-remote-access). It will explain how you can set up a proper MySQL user to make backups.
Afterwards, navigate to https://cdn.qbox.re/dashboard/database-backup and choose the organization you want to use at the top.
Here you can fill in the credentials of the MySQL user you just created.
If everything works, it will create an initial backup and afterwards it will create scheduled backups according to your donation tier.
