Getting VSCode setup for FiveM/RedM scripting is actually really easy. The exentions listed in this blog automatically set most of that up for you! Below we will go over some suggested extensions and addons for VSCode.

## Overview

The extensions listed below will provide:

- Autocompletion for native FiveM/RedM/CFX functions.
- Type-checking using Lua LSP (via EmmyLua-style annotations).
- In-editor documentation for native functions.
- Git functionality like in-editor blame annotations, hovers, CodeLens, and more

## Installation

### 1. Install / Open VSCode

Make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.

### 2. Install the suggested extensions

- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [Lua Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua)
- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [CfxLua IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=communityox.cfxlua-vscode-cox)

## Tips & Tricks

- Hover over native functions (e.g., `GetPlayerRoutingBucket`, `SetEntityCoords`) to view documentation
- Improve IntelliSense and type safety by annotating functions
- You can download support for export autocompletes of the inventory and core resources
    - [ox_types](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_types) adds support for export calls from Overextended resources *(ox_inventory, ox_doorlock, etc)*
    - [qbox_types](https://github.com/ihyajb/qbox_types) adds support for export calls from QBox resources *(qbx_core, qbx_medical, etc)*
:::warning
    After downloading either of the addons, store them in a place you will remember (you will need the file path later)
:::

#### The below image shows `ox_types` adding autocomplete for inventory exports:
![inventory exports](/img/blogs/vscode-setup/inventory.png)

#### The below codeblock shows a correctly annotated function:
- `---@param source Source` tells the intellisense the function expects a source (aka a players server ID) as the first arg
- `---@return boolean` tells the intellisense the function will return a boolean (aka `true` or `false`)
```lua
-- Check if player is whitelisted, kept like this for backwards compatibility or future plans
---@param source Source
---@return boolean
function IsWhitelisted(source)
    if not serverConfig.whitelist then return true end
    if IsPlayerAceAllowed(source --[[@as string]], serverConfig.whitelistPermission) then return true end
    return false
end
```

## Setup & Configuration

The below codeblock shows what your library settings should look like after downloading `ox_types`, `qbox_types` or both

*(To get to the settings, press `F1` and type `settings`)*
:::info
    We add the locally stored `ox_lib` resource path as it automatically adds support for `lib` autocompletes such as `lib.notify`
:::

```lua
"Lua.workspace.library": [
    // EXISTING LIBRARYS HERE
    "F:/GitHub/ox_types/types",
    "F:/GitHub/qbox_types/types",
    "F:/CoolRoleplayServer/resources/[ox]/ox_lib"
],
```

## You're Ready to Code!

Thatâ€™s it! Your VSCode environment is now set up FiveM/RedM Lua development. No more tab-switching to docs. Just clean, typed, and documented code... *hopefully*.
