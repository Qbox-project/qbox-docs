An `fxmanifest.lua` is the backbone of any FiveM resource. It tells the server which files to load, what they do, and how they should be handled—whether that's on the client, server, or both.

## `__resource.lua`  

In older resources, you might come across a file named `__resource.lua`. Before `fxmanifest.lua` existed, this was used to define how a resource behaves. It serves the same purpose but is now outdated and replaced by the fxmanifest system.  

## How to Start an fxmanifest  

When setting up an `fxmanifest.lua`, make sure the file is named exactly that—**fxmanifest.lua**—and is located in your resource folder. Here’s a quick look at what that should look like:

![File example](https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/49PUZpggNXt8.png)

At a minimum, you need to define two things:

- `fx_version`
- `game`

### `fx_version` options:  
- `cerulean` – Newest and most secure (recommended)  
- `bodacious` – Older  
- `adamant` – Legacy version  

### `game` options:
- `gta5` – For FiveM (use this for QBCore/Qbox)  
- `gta4` – For LibertyM (rarely used)  
- `rdr3` – For RedM  
- `common` – Works across games, but lacks access to game-specific natives (not recommended)  

Here’s a basic example:

## Specifics of the Manifest  

### Defining Client and Server Scripts  

The `fxmanifest.lua` lets you define which scripts run on the client (the player’s game) and which run on the server (the host environment).

#### Client Script Example:
```lua
client_script 'client.lua'
```

If your script is inside a folder:
```lua
client_script 'foldername/client.lua'
```

#### Server Script Example:
```lua
server_script 'server.lua'
```

### Defining Multiple Scripts
If you want to load multiple files:
```lua
client_scripts {
    'client.lua',
    'client2.lua'
}
```

Or use a wildcard to include everything in a folder:
```lua
client_scripts {
    'clientfolder/*.lua'
}
```

:::info
- The `*` wildcard includes all `.lua` files in a folder.
- You can use wildcards with folders too.
- More details in the [Resource Manifest documentation](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/resource-manifest/resource-manifest/)

## Shared Scripts  

Shared scripts are loaded by both the client and the server. These are typically used for configs or utility files.

```lua
shared_script 'config.lua'

-- Or multiple files:
shared_scripts {
    'config.lua',
    'shared_utils.lua'
}
```

---

## Dependencies  

### Hard Dependencies  
Hard dependencies ensure a resource won't start unless certain conditions or resources are met.

```lua
dependencies {
    '/server:4500',                 -- Requires server build 4500 or higher
    '/policy:subdir_file_mapping', -- Requires server key permission
    '/onesync',                    -- Requires OneSync
    '/gameBuild:h4',               -- Requires game build 2189 or higher
    '/native:0xE27C97A0',          -- Requires support for this native
    'ox_lib'                       -- Requires ox_lib to be started
}
```

:::info
If any of these are missing, the resource **will not start.**
:::

### Soft Dependencies  
Soft dependencies are optional—if the resource is missing, your script might throw an error, but it will still run.

Defined like this:
```lua
shared_script '@ox_lib/init.lua'
```

---

## Files  

Use the `files` section to include additional files like JSON, images, or configs:

```lua
files {
    'data/main.json',
    'config.ts'
}
```

---

## Vehicles in a Manifest  

To define vehicle-related files, just tell the manifest what each file does:

```lua
fx_version 'cerulean'
game 'gta5'

data_file 'HANDLING_FILE' 'data/**/handling.meta'
data_file 'VEHICLE_METADATA_FILE' 'data/**/vehicles.meta'
data_file 'CARCOLS_FILE' 'data/**/carcols.meta'
data_file 'VEHICLE_VARIATION_FILE' 'data/**/carvariations.meta'

files {
    'data/**/*.meta'
}
```

Wildcards like `**` allow you to include files across subdirectories.

---

## Other Options  

You can also define extra metadata for documentation or internal use:

```lua
author 'John Doe <j.doe@example.com>'
description 'Example resource'
version '1.0.0'

-- Scripts to run
client_scripts {
    'client.lua',
    'client_two.lua'
}
server_script 'server.lua'

-- Custom metadata
my_data 'one' { two = 42 }
my_data 'three' { four = 69 }

-- Alternate syntax
my_data('nine')({ ninety = "nein" })

-- Arbitrary metadata keys are allowed
pizza_topping 'pineapple'
```
