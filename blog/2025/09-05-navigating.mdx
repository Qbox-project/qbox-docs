Working inside Qbox can sometimes feel overwhelming. Whether you need to remove a bugged item, locate a specific message, or figure out where certain data is stored, this guide will show you how to quickly find what you‚Äôre looking for.

## Why Navigation Matters in Qbox

A frequent set of questions from the Discord community:

> - ‚ÄúHow do I remove this message?‚Äù
> - ‚ÄúWhere is this item stored?‚Äù
> - ‚ÄúHow can I change that label?‚Äù

The solution is almost always the same:
üëâ **Use your editor‚Äôs Global Search.**

## Using Global Search in VSCode

Most developers working with Qbox use **Visual Studio Code**. For this guide, we‚Äôll focus on VSCode‚Äôs built-in search.

The default keybinding to search across the entire project is:

```
CTRL + SHIFT + F
```

This opens a search input where you can type any string to quickly locate references throughout your project.

## Example: Changing a Message

Let‚Äôs say you want to change the message:

```
"You are now on duty!"
```

into:

```
"You started your shift!"
```

1. Press **CTRL + SHIFT + F** and enter the original text.
   
   ![Example search](/img/blogs/navigate/example-search.png)

2. VSCode will show you exactly where this text appears. Open the file and update it.

3. Save your changes and restart the script. Done!


## Example: Removing a Message

Sometimes you don‚Äôt just want to change a message. Instead, you want to remove it entirely.

Most Qbox scripts support multiple languages, which means you‚Äôll often be editing **translation files** instead of the direct script. This can feel confusing, because the place where the message is triggered is different from where the text itself is defined.

Take this example:

![Example highlight key](/img/blogs/navigate/example-key-highlight.png)

The blue text is the **translation key**. That‚Äôs how the script calls the message. To track down where this key is used, simply **search for the key name** in your project.

But sometimes keys are **nested**, like this one with the prefix `info`:

![Example nesting](/img/blogs/navigate/example-nesting.png)

In this case, you can add a **dot prefix** before the key when searching, so only this specific value shows up:

![Example dot](/img/blogs/navigate/example-dot.png)

This way, you can quickly identify exactly where and how the message is being used, and safely remove it.

## Final Thoughts


Mastering global search will save you countless hours and questions in Qbox. Instead of digging through folders manually, you‚Äôll be able to instantly locate and edit the messages, items, or data you need.
This concept works for almost anything you‚Äôre trying to find in your project but following labels or keys often gives you the clearest path to the right spot.
