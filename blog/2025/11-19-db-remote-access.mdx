It is beneficial to be able to interact with your database from outside your machine.
Whether you need to perform backups, connect monitoring tools like Grafana, or access your database from different machines, configuring remote access to your MariaDB instance is essential when running a FiveM server with QBox.

In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to safely enable remote connections to your MariaDB database while maintaining security best practices.

:::info
This tutorial is purely targeted at MariaDB (which you should be using for Qbox anyway).
:::

## Step 1: Configure MariaDB Binding

By default, MariaDB only listens on `localhost` (127.0.0.1). To allow remote connections, you need to modify the binding address.
To do this, you will need to locate the configuration file for MariaDB. Depending on your system, it could be in one of these locations:

- **Unix/BSD**: `/etc/my.cnf`
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`
- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\MariaDB X.X\data\my.ini`

> or any other custom location where you installed it

Once you open this file, it will probably look something like this

```ini
[mysqld]
datadir=C:/Program Files/MariaDB 12.0/data
port=3306
innodb_buffer_pool_size=4042M
[client]
port=3306
plugin-dir=C:\Program Files\MariaDB 12.0/lib/plugin
```

Here we will add a line telling MariaDB to listen on all network interfaces by adding the following line under the `[mysqld]` section:

```ini
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
```

Your file should now look like this

```ini
[mysqld]
datadir=C:/Program Files/MariaDB 12.0/data
port=3306
innodb_buffer_pool_size=4042M
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
[client]
port=3306
plugin-dir=C:\Program Files\MariaDB 12.0/lib/plugin
```

### Restart MariaDB

For these changes to take effect, we will need to restart MariaDB. This will temporarily stop your database service, so plan accordingly.

:::warning
If your server is currently live, please wait in between restarts to do this.
:::

**Linux (systemd):**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
```

**Windows (Command Prompt as Administrator):**
```cmd
net stop MariaDB
net start MariaDB
```


## Step 2: Create a Remote Access User

For security reasons, we will create a user without destructive permissions.
In case of hijacking or if someone guesses your password, there will be no damage done. We will need to open the MySQL interface first.

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows" default>
      On Windows you simply press the Windows key and search for `mariadb`.
      You will find `MySQL Client (MariaDB X.X (x64))`, open this. Now fill in your root password or simply press enter if you have none.
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
      In the CLI simply enter `mariadb` and press enter. If you are currently root in Linux or have sudo, you will automatically access the MariaDB environment.
      But if it asks for a password, simply fill in the password for your MySQL root user and then press enter.
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now we will create a SQL user called `special_user` with the password `strong_password_here`. You can copy and paste the following.
:::warning
Do this line per line so you can change the password and username.
If you copy paste every line at once it will directly go through without you having the chance to change stuff.
:::
:::info
Please change the password to something strong. Save it, remember it, and keep it secure. Also change the name of the user for added obscurity.
:::

```sql
CREATE USER 'special_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password_here';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'special_user'@'%';
GRANT SHOW VIEW, TRIGGER ON *.* TO 'special_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

**Permissions explained:**
- `SELECT` - Read data from tables
- `SHOW VIEW` - View database views and schemas
- `TRIGGER` - Read trigger information

To verify the user was created successfully, run:

```sql
SELECT USER, HOST FROM mysql.user;
```

which outputs:

```powershell
+--------------+-----------+
| User         | Host      |
+--------------+-----------+
| special_user | %         |
| root         | 127.0.0.1 |
| root         | ::1       |
| root         | computer  |
| mariadb.sys  | localhost |
| root         | localhost |
+--------------+-----------+
```

You should see `special_user` listed with host `%` among the other users.

> Notice that root is listed with the host `127.0.0.1`. This means that despite MariaDB now being accessible for remote connections, root is not.
> So even if root doesn't have a password set it is safe from outside attacks.

:::warning
If this is not the case, you should disallow root from the host `%` or add a strong password for the root account.
:::

## Step 3: Configure Firewall Rules

Allow port 3306 (default MariaDB port) through the firewall:

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows" default>
      1. Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
      2. Click "Inbound Rules" → "New Rule"
      3. Select "Port" → "Next"
      4. Choose "TCP" and enter port `3306`
      5. Select "Allow the connection"
      6. Apply to desired profiles and complete the wizard
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
      ```bash
      sudo ufw allow 3306/tcp
      sudo ufw reload
      ```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
If your database is located on a machine behind a DDoS provider, they might block connections on non-gaming-related ports.
If this is the case, contact your hosting provider for solutions.

## Conclusion

You have successfully configured your MariaDB database for remote access. By following this guide, you've:

- Modified the MariaDB binding to listen on all network interfaces
- Created a dedicated remote user with appropriate read-only permissions
- Configured your firewall to allow remote connections
- Secured your root account by keeping it local-only

This setup allows you to safely perform remote backups, connect monitoring tools like Grafana, and manage your database from outside your machine while maintaining security best practices.
The `special_user` account provides read-only access, ensuring that even if credentials are compromised, your data remains protected from destructive actions.

Remember to keep your passwords strong, update MariaDB regularly, and monitor your connections for any suspicious activity.
