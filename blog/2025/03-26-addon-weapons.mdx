Installing and streaming a new weapon on your FiveM server is actually pretty simple. However, most people struggle to make this work with `ox_inventory`. This guide will also cover how to stream custom weapons on your server.

{/* truncate */}

## Streaming custom weapons

Generally, the act of adding custom assets to your server is called "streaming" because all the textures and 3D models are placed in a `stream` folder. This is why you will often see people asking, "How do I stream x?"

### Finding an example resource

Now let's find a suitable resource. You can either search the official [Cfx.re forums](https://forum.cfx.re/search?q=%23releases%20%20tags%3Aweapons%2Cweapon) or browse modding websites like [GTA5-Mods](https://www.gta5-mods.com/weapons). For this guide, we will be using the [LWRC M6IC](https://www.gta5-mods.com/weapons/modular-lwrc-m6ic) made by [FluffyPlays22](https://www.gta5-mods.com/users/FluffyPlays22). Why? Because the creator used a program known as [vWeaponsToolkit](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tool-vweaponstoolkit-create-addon-weapons-with-ease/4733757), which ensures that the creator's assets are correctly registered and streamed to FiveM. We can verify this with the following:
- A separate folder containing all the contents along with an `fxmanifest.lua` file. This ensures FiveM recognizes the folder as a resource.
- All [asset-related files](https://rage.re/t/rage-format-names-glossary/28#list-of-known-formats-2) in the `stream` folder:
  - `*.ytd` for textures
  - `*.ydr` for 3D models
- All `*.meta` files, which are necessary to inform the GTA engine how to handle the weapon:
  - `weapons.meta` for information related to the weapon itself (weapon name, ammo type, audio item, etc.)
  - `weaponanimations.meta` so the game knows which animation to play for certain actions
  - `weaponarchetypes.meta` to link the correct texture (`.ytd`) files to the weapon
  - `weaponcomponents.meta` to register additional components like scopes, silencers, etc.—that is, attachments that determine which 3D model (`.ydr`) to use and where to position it on the weapon
  - `pedpersonality.meta` to detail how certain [ped models](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/ped-models/) behave when using the weapon
- Everything properly linked in the `fxmanifest.lua` file

### Adding the resource to your server

Now that we know this works properly in FiveM, let's add it to our `resources` folder. Since you will likely have more than one weapon, create a new folder called `[weapons]` (with brackets). The brackets ensure that FXServer recognizes this folder as a category, so it will load all folders inside the category as long as they contain an `fxmanifest.lua` file.
:::info
For additional information on this matter read the [FiveM documentation](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-manual/introduction/introduction-to-resources/).
:::
Knowing this lets make the following folder structure.
```
resources/
├── [qbx]
├── [weapons]/
│   └── m6ic/
│       ├── stream/
│       │   ├── *.ydr
│       │   └── *.ytd
│       ├── meta/
│       │   └── *.meta
│       ├── cl_weaponNames.lua
│       └── fxmanifest.lua
└── [standalone]
```
And don't forget to add `ensure [weapons]` to your `server.cfg` file or any other `.cfg` file that gets read. If you did everything correctly, there are a few indicators to make sure that FXServer recognizes the resource.
- The console will show that the resource is being loaded. In this case it will even give us a warning about the physical memory size of the texture dictionary file
![Console output](/img/blogs/install-custom-weapons/console-information-1.png)
- In txAdmin under the resource tab, we will see that the resource is started

### Testing the weapon
Better yet, use the following code to test whether the weapon works in-game! First, determine the weapon's name by browsing the `weapons.meta` file. Soon you’ll come across the `CWeaponInfo` entry; its first line shows the weapon name—in this case, `WEAPON_M6IC`.
![Weapon name](/img/blogs/install-custom-weapons/weapon-name-code.png)

We will use this name in the following code.
```lua
RegisterCommand('getweapon', function()
    ExecuteCommand('stop ox_inventory')
    Wait(150)
    local ped = PlayerPedId()
    GiveWeaponToPed(ped, GetHashKey('WEAPON_M6IC'), 250, false, true)
    SetCurrentPedWeapon(ped, GetHashKey('WEAPON_M6IC'), true)
end)
```
:::info
We temporarily stop `ox_inventory` because it has security measures to prevent equipping weapons that are not registered in the inventory. This command is for testing purposes only.
:::
#### The weapon works!
![Weapon in game](/img/blogs/install-custom-weapons/weapon-ingame.png)

For good measure, let's also test the components included with the resource. To do this, look in the `weaponcomponents.meta` file, specifically the "Name" entries. Fortunately, the naming scheme is self-explanatory—for example, `COMPONENT_M6IC_FLSH_02` is a flashlight attachment, etc. By reviewing the list, you can identify each attachment and apply it to the weapon.
```lua
RegisterCommand('getweapon', function()
    ExecuteCommand('stop ox_inventory')
    Wait(150)
    local ped = PlayerPedId()
    GiveWeaponToPed(ped, GetHashKey('WEAPON_M6IC'), 250, false, true)
    SetCurrentPedWeapon(ped, GetHashKey('WEAPON_M6IC'), true)

    GiveWeaponComponentToPed(ped, GetHashKey('WEAPON_M6IC'), GetHashKey('COMPONENT_M6IC_CLIP_06'))
    GiveWeaponComponentToPed(ped, GetHashKey('WEAPON_M6IC'), GetHashKey('COMPONENT_M6IC_FLSH_02'))
    GiveWeaponComponentToPed(ped, GetHashKey('WEAPON_M6IC'), GetHashKey('COMPONENT_M6IC_SUPP_03'))
    GiveWeaponComponentToPed(ped, GetHashKey('WEAPON_M6IC'), GetHashKey('COMPONENT_M6IC_STOCK_05'))
    GiveWeaponComponentToPed(ped, GetHashKey('WEAPON_M6IC'), GetHashKey('COMPONENT_M6IC_FRAME_02'))
end)
```

## Configuring ox_inventory

Now that we know the weapon works, we can configure `ox_inventory` to work with both the weapon and its attachments.

### Adding the weapon

Everything you need is in one file called `weapons.lua`—this is where all information regarding weapons, components, and ammo is stored.
```
ox_inventory/
└── data/
    └── weapons.lua
```
First thing you will see is the `Weapons` table. This is where all the weapons are stored. Remember how to find the weapon name of the weapon inside the `weapons.meta` file? We will be using that name here.
```lua
Weapons = {
    ['WEAPON_M6IC'] = {
        label = 'LWRC M6IC',
        weight = 3300,
        durability = 0.03,
        ammoname = 'ammo-rifle2',
    },
}
```
And that's it! These six simple lines will ensure your weapon works with `ox_inventory`. Now, go in-game and test it out.
```
/giveitem 1 WEAPON_M6IC 1
```
Remember that we assigned it the `ammo-rifle2` ammo type, which already exists in `ox_inventory`. 
```
/giveitem 1 ammo-rifle2 400
```
![Weapon in inventory](/img/blogs/install-custom-weapons/weapon-in-inventory.png)
<ReactPlayer url='/img/blogs/install-custom-weapons/using-ox_inventory.mp4' controls='true' />

### Adding components

Stay within the same `weapons.lua` file. Use **CTRL + F** and search for `Components` to find the table with all the components inside.
![Components table](/img/blogs/install-custom-weapons/search-vscode.png)

Here, copy another entry. The key will be the name used with the `/giveitem` command, for example `m6ic_flashlight_01`. Then create an entry for each component. How do you know which component the item should apply? Check the weapon’s `weaponcomponents.meta` file for the registered components—in this case, `COMPONENT_M6IC_FLSH_01`.

If you did everything correctly your code should look like this.
```lua
['m6ic_flashlight_01'] = {
    label = 'Tactical Flashlight',
    weight = 120,
    type = 'flashlight',
    client = {
        component = {
            `COMPONENT_M6IC_FLSH_01`,
        },
        usetime = 2500
    }
},
```
<ReactPlayer url='/img/blogs/install-custom-weapons/vscode-component.mp4' controls='true' />
:::info
One flashlight is black for the normal frame, while the other is tanned because the weapon includes a component (`COMPONENT_M6IC_FRAME_02`) to tint the frame.
:::
<ReactPlayer url='/img/blogs/install-custom-weapons/different-flashlights.mp4' controls='true' />

Now rinse and repeat for all the other components!
